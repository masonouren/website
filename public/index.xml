      <description>Reticulate and Logistic RegressionAs a beginner in the world of programming and data science, learning R and Python have been valuable in whetting my appetite for further learning in how to manage and interpret data. While I have spent a little more time working in R the past few months, I want to briefly discuss some of my initial insights regarding Python.
First, I appreciate how Python and R can interact; for someone more comfortable with R, it is good to know that these languages can speak to each other to accomplish desired tasks.</description>

      <description>Project 2: ModelingFor this project, I selected a dataset containing information about dementia patients. The variables in this dataset include patient identification, dementia status (binary; either demented or nondemented), gender (M/F), age, years of education (EDUC), socioeconomic status (SES), score from a minimal mental state exam (MMSE), estimated total intracranial volume (eTIV), normalized whole brain volume (nWBV), and the Atlas scaling factor (ASF) (this was not used much in the practical analysis).</description>

      <description>IntroductionFor this project, I selected two datasets that both contained data on various countries around the world. While one contained many different statistics on countries around the world collected by the US government (like population, region, area size, infant mortality, etc.), the other contained the World Happiness Report collected by the Gallup World Poll. It contains 6 key variables and the extent that they determine a countryâ€™s happiness: Economy (GDP), Family, Life Expectancy, Freedom, Trust in the Government, and Generosity.</description>
